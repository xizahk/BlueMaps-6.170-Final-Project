![Image of Blue Maps](resources/images/blue_maps.png)

BlueMap's purpose is to revolutionize green travel planning in Boston by providing 
a way for users to plan walking and biking trips using Blue Bikes.
Our goal is two-fold: automatically generate planned trips for Boston residents
and visitors and also reduce the amount of carbon emissions in Boston by 
encouraging traveling via walking/biking instead of driving.
